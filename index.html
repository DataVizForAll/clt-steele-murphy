          <p class="lead">An innovative strategy to combat the affordable housing shortage are “community land trusts” (CLTs).</p>

          <p>An innovative strategy to combat the affordable housing shortage are “community land trusts” (CLTs). Finding affordable and accessible housing is a crisis families and communities have to grapple with all over the world. Connecticut’s housing crisis, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, “experienced the 7th highest percent change in housing prices, at 9.64%...That figure outpaces the average national increase, which stood for 6.6%” (Ragland). The increase in housing prices is a major factor to the affordable housing shortage. Community land trusts are designed to provide and maintain affordable housing as a feasible opportunity for low-income families. CLTs acquire ownership of properties and allow families to purchase the homes. This separates the ownership of the land from the houses, helping to reduce housing costs and ensure housing costs stay affordable.</p>

          <p>In the Hartford region, an example of a community land trust is Urban Suburban Affordables (USA), Inc, connected to the Center for Leadership and Justice (CLJ), a nonprofit organization. USA has over 200 homes in our community. Community land trust organizations, like USA, play a crucial role in fostering stability within communities by addressing housing affordability challenges. These organizations help stabilize neighborhoods, particularly for low- and moderate-income families, by ensuring long-term access to affordable housing. By removing land from speculative real estate markets, they protect residents from displacement due to rising property values. Community land trusts are essential tools for addressing housing inequality and preserving affordability.</p>

          <p>How do USA homes compare to similar houses in the neighborhood or block? To answer this question, we investigated how a sample of USA homes measures up to comparable homes, or comps, in southwest Hartford, census tract 5048. Within census tract 5048, there were three roads that multiple USA homes were located on. Those three roads were Hillside Avenue, Linnmoore Street, and Roger Street. We primarily focused on the USA homes on those streets and comparable properties surrounding the USA properties. We focused on fourteen non-USA homes, about three homes per USA house. The most suitable properties for comparison are those located in the same or adjacent neighborhoods and share comparable characteristics, including total living area and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Analyzing similar properties provides a measurement for property values, valuation, negotiation, and market analysis, being an essential tool for people involved in real estate.</p>

          <p>Is the USA program working as designed? Community Land Trusts (CLTs) like Urban Suburban Affordables (USA) play a critical role in addressing housing inequality by maintaining affordability in the face of rising property values and a “worsening housing crisis” (Ragland). CLTs provide ownership opportunities for individuals who might otherwise be priced out of the housing market, making homeownership more accessible. "Working as designed" for a community land trust means achieving these goals—providing homes at sustainable prices. If USA homes hold market values similar to comparable properties, it indicates a balance between affordability and market viability, suggesting success in their mission to stabilize neighborhoods without devaluing assets. This alignment underscores how CLTs can offer equitable housing solutions which integrate affordability with quality living standards.</p>

          <h2 align="center">Methods</h2>
<p>To compare properties in this census tract, USA homes provided addresses for the properties they manage. From this data spreadsheet, we cleaned it to remove all properties not located in Hartford, then sorted all remaining data by our census tract. To gather data on the properties in census tract 5048, we used appraiser field cards from the city of Hartford Open Data Repository, CAMAGIS property assessor and information we found on Zillow. CAMAGIS is a software that integrates CAMA and GIS systems to allow viewers to gather data and create visualizations using the information provided through maps and property information. It was crucial to clean and sort the data found in this dataset, as it was an overwhelming amount of data that it would have been challenging to extract any information as it was when presented to us. After some time, we realized there were three streets within our census tract where several USA properties were located; Hillside Avenue, Linnmoore Street and Roger Street. We then further divided the spreadsheets by streets and worked on creating visualizations from the data collected.</p>
<p>Since our information and findings will be public for all to see, to protect the privacy of the homeowners, we could not use specific addresses of USA homes. Instead, we used various techniques to distinguish between non-USA homes and the USA homes; letter codes (that were provided to us by Jack), using separate graphs for USA homes and non-USA homes, and differentiated the homes by colors.</p>
<p>There were a couple of instances we felt it was important to include some caveats and our trepidation including some data. An important caveat to note is Zillow has the tendency to overestimate the prices of homes. Zillow’s estimates are based on algorithms which may not account for local factors. Automated valuations might misrepresent the true value of homes, especially in unique housing models like CLTs. These estimates lack context about neighborhood trends and broader economic conditions, which may lead to dubious conclusions. Although an overestimation is not ideal, the information we used from Zillow is important and valuable in observing significant trends and patterns. Also, despite our best efforts, something we could not control is some of the data was not available. Although also not ideal, it did not profoundly affect our insights and data collection.</p>

          <h4>Market value of USA homes compared to street block or census tract</h4> 
        
          <p>The four bar graphs compare market values of properties on a Hillside Avenue block, a Linnmoore Street block, and two locations on Roger Street. Properties in dark blue are USA Homes, while the gray bars represent single-family homes not in the community land trust, but in the same neighborhood. The value of single family homes varies reflecting differences in condition, age, and general characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage).</p>

            <p>Figure 1.1: Hillside Avenue Comparsion Infomation. Properties A, B, and C (non-USA Homes) show similar market values and property H46 has a slightly lower market value. From looking at the data we found property H46 is surrounded by multi-family homes and larger single family homes. The immediate neighborhood composition can significantly influence property values and creates complexity in finding comparables as different home types have different valuation metrics compared to single-family homes. This property required a nuanced approach to valuation, considering the diverse housing stock. Explore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ACycD/2/">interactive chart</a>.</p>

          <p align="center">Importance</p>
        
<p>The graphs suggest that homes in a community land trust (CLT) may have similar or even higher market values compared to some single-family homes on these blocks. This challenges assumptions CLT homes are significantly undervalued in the real estate market, demonstrating they can have competitive market values while promoting affordability. CLTs are designed to create affordable housing options and this data shows they can maintain competitive market values. This is crucial for advocating for CLTs as a sustainable model for housing affordability while reshaping the narrative about the effectiveness and value of this housing model. A community land trust can be a resource to prevent displacement by acquiring and maintaining affordable land. Location is crucial to ensuring existing residents can remain in areas experiencing rising property values.</p>
<p>The market value of properties directly impacts a community land trust's strategic ability to support accessible housing initiatives, serving as a fundamental element in its mission-driven work. Market value affects the cost of purchasing and maintaining land. High land values can make it challenging for CLTs to acquire properties. Lower market values allow CLTs to purchase land more affordably, increasing their ability to provide housing at below market rates. Market values also influence the resale prices of homes. A balance is needed between affordability for future buyers and allowing current homeowners to build equity. High market values in the surrounding area can pressure a CLT to ensure affordability while managing rising costs.</p>




          <h4>Market value growth (2016-24) of USA homes compared to street block or census tract</h4>
        
          <p>The following charts show the market value growth over a ten year period, based on zillow estimates. The first group of charts shows one USA-home and one non-USA home on Linnmoore street. The second group of charts also shows one USA-home and one non-USA home on, but on Roger Street. The data in both of these charts is from Zillow. As mentioned before, Zillow tends to overestimate prices, but the trends shown are still relevant. </p> 

          <iframe title="Market Value Growth Comparison on Linnmoore Street (Dec 2014- Nov 2024)" aria-label="Multiple Lines" id="datawrapper-chart-s2JUM" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s2JUM/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="317" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
            <p>Figure 2.1: Market Value Growth Comparsion on Linnmoore Street. The two properties, a USA-Home (H52) and a non-USA home, show an increase in market value, with notable increases around 2020-2024, likely influenced by housing market trends. The rates of growth vary, with the second house shown here experiencing the steepest incline in value, particularly after 2020. H52 is the USA home on this block and the upward trend in market value suggests resale restrictions would be necessary to maintain affordability for future residents. Without these measures, rising values could challenge the community land trust’s goal of providing long-term affordable housing. The increase in property value for all homes indicates the street block has likely become more desirable. For a community land trust, the growth can be used to assess how to balance resident affordability with neighborhood improvement trends.

         <iframe title="Market Value Growth Comparison on Roger Street (Dec 2014- Nov 2024)" aria-label="Multiple Lines" id="datawrapper-chart-6cjwL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6cjwL/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="302" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
          <p>Figure 2.2: Market Value Growth Comparsion on Roger Street. The USA home and the non-USA Home on Roger Street had similar patterns and trends in price over time. The non-USA home throughout the pandemic had a slightly more steady increase while the USA Home value was more sporadic. Tracking market value growth allows CLJ to track the different changes and patterns in the neighborhood of the USA homes so that the USA homes can stay up to the trends with the subsequent neighborhood.

<p align="center">Importance</p>
            
          <p> Market growth comparison analysis can reveal growth in property values, indicating a rising demand and economic development in the area. Rising property values can affect affordability and lead to displacement of lower-income residents, altering the socioeconomic composition of the area. Tracking these trends helps affordable housing initiatives assess if growth is sustainable or if it risks destabilization within the community. </p> 

          
          <h4>Owner-occupied rate of USA homes compared to street block or census tract</h4>     
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Rate of USA homes" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-3QA1Z" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3QA1Z/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="240" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
          
   <p>Figure 3: Owner-Occupied Rate of USA homes. This data is looking at the number of housing units in census tract 5048. This data shows 67.1% of occupied housing units are owner occupied, while 32.9% are renter occupied. The 53 vacant units results in a vacancy rate of 2.87%. The information suggests the census tract 5048 has a relatively tight housing market. Exlpore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3QA1Z/6/">interactive</a>.</p>  
            
          <p align="center">Math</p>
          <p>To determine the owner-occupied rate, the number of renter occupied units is subtracted from the number of occupied housing units </p> 
<p>Owner-occupied units = 1,794 - 591 = 1,203</p>
<p>The number of owner occupied units is then divided by the number of occupied housing units, multiplied by 100.</p>
<p>Owner-Occupied rate = (1,203 / 1,794) x 100 = 67.1%</p>

            <p align="center">Importance</p>

<p>Data from the census tract is important to know because it will illustrate the CLTs potential impact on owner-occupancy rates.</p>  
<p>If USA homes are 100% owner occupied, it reflects Center for Leadership and Justice’s commitment to providing affordable, stable housing and building wealth through ownership. The assumption of 100% owner occupancy is based on data and is our belief but without clear evidence, this is a strong assumption rather than a fact. When USA homes are entirely owner-occupied, it demonstrates the effectiveness of community land trusts in developing innovative and sustainable homeownership models.</p>
<p>If USA homes are entirely owner-occupied, it indicates CLT properties are positively contributing to higher owner-occupancy rates within the neighborhoods they are located in. This is especially significant in areas where renter-occupied housing is dominant, as a CLT can help to shift the balance toward ownership for lower-income families. High owner-occupancy rates are associated with increased community stability and better maintenance of properties.</p>

          
          <h4>Foreclose rate of USA homes compared to foreclosure/eviction rate on block or tract</h4>
        
<p>This data provides insights into foreclosure rates in Southwest Hartford compared to rates in census tract 5048. This data is critical for identifying and comparing foreclosure trends across different samples. Foreclosure rates are an important metric and are helpful for assessing housing market stability.</p>

<iframe title="Southwest Hartford" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-O9X5L" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O9X5L/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="890" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
      <p>Figure 4:This table represents a larger sample of data from Southwest Hartford. In this table. Foreclosures account for approximately 15 out of 1,597 total sales, resulting in a foreclosure rate of approximately 0.94% of all recorded sales. This low rate suggests a relatively stable housing market across the southwest Hartford area. A relatively low foreclosure rate suggests a relatively stable housing market.

</script>
          </p>Figure 5: This table depicts the sale code for USA/CLJ properties in the census tract. Foreclosures make up 1 out of 14 transactions or 7.14%. While this rate appears significantly higher, the sample size is much smaller (14 transactions). A single foreclosure in a small sample can disproportionately impact the rate as each instance carries more statistical weight. A single foreclosure might reflect an isolated incident rather than a systemic issue. While foreclosures can impact perceptions of housing stability and economic challenges, it does not indicate these homes are less stable or are more prone to foreclosure. The larger sample provides a more reliable foreclosure trend, as the smaller sample’s data is less representative. The larger southwest Hartford market shows stability and percentages in small datasets can be misleading. The higher foreclosure rate should be interpreted as a data point, not as conclusive evidence of a problem.

    <p align="center">Importance</p>
            
          <p>Comparing foreclosure rates in Southwest Hartford and census tract 5048 can highlight vulnerabilities and the economic well-being of residents. Lower rates suggest more stable homeownership and financial resilience, while higher rates reflect unemployment, economic inequality, or systemic barriers. Foreclosures disrupt communities by leading to vacant properties and declining property values. An analysis of a census tract offers insights into how localized these disruptions are and how they compare to regional patterns.</p>

          

          <h4>Individual vs corporate/LLC ownership rate of USA homes compared to block or tract</h4>

          <p>As shown by the graphs, most of the properties surrounding USA homes are individually owned and not owned by a business or corporation. This is a promising trend for the goal of stabilizing the community. LLC’s are most likely trying to convert homes into rental properties, so the presence of a lot of LLC's would make it difficult to know the occupancy rate. Rental properties could be a downside for people who want to build equity through homeownership. This is further insight on the makeup of the neighborhoods USA homes are located in Census Tract 5048.</p>
          
      <p class="lead">Big Picture:</p>
<p> Community land trusts, such as Urban Suburban Affordables, play a pivotal role in addressing the affordable housing crisis by maintaining long term housing affordability and stability for long and moderate income families. This is achieved by separating land ownership from property ownership, reducing costs and protecting residents from rising property values. USA is providing neighborhood stabilization by promoting homeownership, which is a wealth-building opportunity for residents. Properties owned by USA have market values comparable or higher than neighboring houses, indicating affordability can coexist with competitive property values. Although there are data limitations, such as a reliance on Zillow which poses an obstacle to precise analysis, CLTs help maintain affordability. Community land trusts are effective tools for mitigating housing crises, stabilizing communities, and balancing affordability, but require nuanced strategies to address challenges like rising land costs. </p>
