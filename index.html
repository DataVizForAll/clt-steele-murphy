          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lead">Pull readers into your data story with a compelling introduction. Notice how this paragraph appears in a larger font than others, because the HTML code begins with a "lead" class.</p>

          <p>A good introduction raises your guiding question, outlines key findings that answer it, and explains why it matters to both our community partner. Since you also need to provide essential background information for general readers, a typical introduction requires at least 2-3 paragraphs.</p>

          <p>Compose your data story in your Google Doc, where it's easier to write and edit, especially when working with other people. When you're ready, create your own copy of this <a href="https://github.com/DataVizForAll/dataviz-story-template">GitHub dataviz-story-template </a>, and publish it online using Settings > Pages. When your version is published, copy and paste the live web link into your README file so you can easily find it.</p>

          <p>In your GitHub copy of this template, open the "index.html" file to see how everything must be written in HTML format. Click the pencil symbol in GithHub to edit the file. HINT: In the upper-right corner, switch the dropdown menu from "No Wrap" to "Soft Wrap" to easily view long segments of code in your screen.</p>

          <p>Paragraphs like this one must begin with a "p" tag and end with a "p" closing tag.</p>

          <p>Links must begin and end with "a" anchor tags, with the web address inside either single or double quotes. If you need guidance, check out this <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp'>W3Schools HTML Tutorial</a>.

          <h2>Findings</h2>

          <p class="lead">Market value of USA homes compared to street block or census tract</p> 

          <p>The four bar graphs compare market values of properties on a Hillside Avenue block, a Linnmoore Street block, and two locations on Roger Street. Properties in dark blue are USA Homes, while the gray bars represent single-family homes not in the community land trust, but in the same neighborhood. The value of single family homes varies reflecting differences in condition, age, and general characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage).

</script>

            <p>General Conclusions</p>
<p>Hillside Avenue Block: Properties A, C, and D (non-USA Homes) show similar market values and property B has a slightly lower market value.</p> 
<p>Linnmoore Street Block: Properties D and F (USA Homes) show higher or comparable market values relative to property E.</p> 
<p>Roger Street (house in the lower numbers): Property A (USA-Home) has a slightly lower market value than the surrounding properties </p>
<p>Roger Street (two USA-homes in close proximity, higher numbers): The homes surrounding Property A and B (the USA homes) are more scattered, as properties, such as F are higher and properties, such as E are lower than the USA homes.</p>
          <p>Importance</p>
<p>The graphs suggest that homes in a community land trust (CLT) may have similar or even higher market values compared to some single-family homes on these blocks. This challenges assumptions that CLT homes are significantly undervalued in the real estate market, demonstrating that they can retain competitive market values while promoting affordability.</p>
<p>Market value is a crucial factor for a community land trust because it directly influences the trust’s ability to fulfill its mission of providing affordable housing. Market value affects the cost of purchasing and maintaining land. High land values can make it challenging for CLTs to acquire properties. Lower market values allow CLTs to purchase land more affordably, increasing their ability to provide housing at below market rates.
Market value also influences resale prices of homes. A balance is needed between affordability for future buyers and allowing current homeowners to build equity. High market values in the surrounding area can pressure a CLT to ensure affordability while managing rising costs.</p>
 


          <p class="lead">Market value growth (2016-24) of USA homes compared to street block or census tract</p>

          <p> The following charts show the market value growth over a ten year period, based on zillow estimates. The first group of charts shows one USA-homes and two non-USA home on Linnmoore street. The second group of charts also shows one USA-home and two non-USA homes on, but on Roger Street. This chart is from Zillow. As mentioned before, Zillow tends to overestimate prices, but the trends shown are still relevant.</p> 

          <img scr="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 7.36.39 PM.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0"> 

          <p> All 3 properties show an increase in market value, including the USA home, with notable increases around 2020-2024, likely influenced by housing market trends. The rates of growth vary, with the second house shown here experiencing the steepest incline in value, particularly after 2020. 
H52 is the USA home on this block and the upward trend in market value suggests resale restrictions would be necessary to maintain affordability for future residents. Without these measures, rising values could challenge the community land trust’s goal of providing long-term affordable housing. 
The increase in property value for all homes indicates the area (street block) has likely become more desirable. For a community land trust, the growth can be used to assess how to balance resident affordability with neighborhood improvement trends.</p>
          
          <img scr="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 7.41.51 PM.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>The USA home and the non-USA Home on Roger Street had similar patterns and trends in price over time. The non-USA home throughout the pandemic had a slightly more steady increase while the USA Home value was more sporadic. This pattern makes sense because the pandemic was a time of extreme uncertainty, from paychecks and jobs themselves not always being secured, making affordable housing more appealing. Tracking market value growth allows CLJ to track the different changes and patterns in the neighborhood of the USA homes so that the USA homes can stay up to the trends with the subsequent neighborhood.</p> 

          <p class="lead">Owner-occupied rate of USA homes compared to street block or census tract</p> 
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Rate of USA homes" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-3QA1Z" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3QA1Z/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="224" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
          <p>This data is looking at the number of housing units in census tract 5048. To determine the owner-occupied rate, the number of renter occupied units is subtracted from the number of occupied housing units </p> 
<p>Owner-occupied units = 1,794 - 591 = 1,203</p>
<p>The number of owner occupied units is then divided by the number of occupied housing units, multiplied by 100.</p>
<p>Owner-Occupied rate = (1,203 / 1,794) x 100 = 67.1%</p>
<p>This data shows 67.1% of occupied housing units are owner occupied, while 32.9% are renter occupied. The 53 vacant units results in a vacancy rate of 2.87%. The information suggests the census tract 5048 has a relatively tight housing market. </p>

<p>The data from the census tract can be linked to the concept of CLT homes to illustrate their potential impact on owner-occupancy rates.</p>  
<p>If USA homes are 100% owner occupied, it reflects CLJs commitment to providing affordable, stable housing and building wealth through ownership. The assumption of 100% owner occupancy is based on data and is our belief. Without clear evidence, this is a strong assumption rather than a fact. If USA homes are 100% owner-occupied, this underscores the effectiveness of CLTs in promoting sustainable homeownership models.</p>
<p>If USA homes are entirely owner-occupied, it indicates CLT properties may be positively contributing to higher owner-occupancy rates within the neighborhoods they are located in. This is especially significant in areas where renter-occupied housing is dominant, as CLTs help shift the balance toward ownership. High owner-occupancy rates are associated with increased community stability and better maintenance of properties.</p>
 
          <p class="lead">Foreclose rate of USA homes compared to foreclosure/eviction rate on block or tract</p>
<p>This data provides insights into foreclosure rates in Southwest Hartford compared to rates in census tract 5048. This data is critical for identifying and comparing foreclosure trends across different samples. Foreclosure rates are an important metric and are helpful for assessing housing market stability.</p>

<iframe title="Southwest Hartford" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-O9X5L" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O9X5L/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="890" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

          <p>This table represents a larger sample of data from Southwest Hartford. In this table. Foreclosures account for approximately 15 out of 1,597 total sales, resulting in a foreclosure rate of approximately 0.94% of all recorded sales. This low rate suggests a relatively stable housing market across the southwest Hartford area. A relatively low foreclosure rate suggests a relatively stable housing market.</p>

          <iframe title="Census Tract 5048 Information" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-2B5wx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2B5wx/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="446" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

          <p>This table depicts the sale code for USA/CLJ properties in the census tract. Foreclosures make up 1 out of 14 transactions or 7.14%. While this rate appears significantly higher, the sample size is much smaller (14 transactions). A single foreclosure in a small sample can disproportionately impact the rate as each instance carries more statistical weight. A single foreclosure might reflect an isolated incident rather than a systemic issue. It does not necessarily indicate these home are less stable or are more prone to foreclosure.The larger sample provides a more reliable foreclosure trend, while the smaller sample’s rate is less representative.Foreclosures can impact perceptions of housing stability and economic challenges. The larger southwest Hartford market shows stability and percentages in small datasets can be misleading. The higher foreclosure rate should be interpreted as a data point, not as conclusive evidence of a problem.</p>

          

          <p class="lead">Individual vs corporate/LLC ownership rate of USA homes compared to block or tract</p> 

          <p> These graphs compare the amount of individual owned homes and the buildings that are under a LLC on Roger Street. The homes included in this chart are the same single-family homes that we used in the previous graphics. All of the USA homes in our dataset were individually owned, so there is no need to differentiate in a binary variable like ownership rate. Each graph shows the USA homes surrounding each of the featured USA homes on Roger Street.</p> 


<img scr= "LLC vs Individual Ownership for Houses Surrounding an USA Home on Roger Street.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>As shown through the graphs, most of the properties surrounding USA homes are individually owned and not owned by a business or corporation. LLC’s are most likely trying to convert the homes into rental properties. Rental properties could be a downside for people that want to build up equity. This is further insight on the makeup of the neighborhoods USA homes are located in Census Tract 5048. This is important information to know because it might not be desirable for future USA home-owners to live in a neighborhood that is  surrounded by businesses and instead would prefer a neighborhood setting.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>To compare properties in this census tract, USA/CLJ homes provided addresses for the properties they manage. From this data spreadsheet, we cleaned it to remove all properties not located in Hartford, then sorted all remaining data by our census tract. To gather data on the properties in census tract 5048, we used appraiser field cards from the city of Hartford Open Data Repository, CAMAGIS property assessor and information we found on Zillow. CAMAGIS is a software that integrates CAMA and GIS systems that allows viewers to gather data and create visualizations using the information provided, through maps and property information.  It was crucial to clean and sort the data found in this dataset, as it was very large and overwhelming to extract any information as it stood. After some time, we realized that there were three streets within our census tract that had many USA properties; Hillside Avenue, Linnmoore Street and Roger Street. We then further divided the spreadsheets by streets and worked on creating our visualizations from that point. Since our information and findings will be public for all to see, to protect the privacy of the homeowners, we could not include specific addresses. Instead, we used various techniques to distinguish between non-USA homes and USA homes; color-coded, letter code and having separate graphs of the data.</p>  
<p>There were a couple of instances that we felt it was important to include some caveats and our trepidation including some data. First, an important caveat to note is that Zillow has the tendency to overestimate the prices of homes. Although an overestimation is not ideal, the information we used from Zillow was still important and valuable in observing significant trends and patterns. Also, despite our best efforts, something we could not control is that some of the data was not available. However, although also not ideal, it did not profoundly affect our insights and data collection.</p>  

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future Trinity College students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, like this example from <a href='https://data.ct.gov'>CT Open Data</a>. Also link to your shared Google Sheets when appropriate.</p>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h2>Sources</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg .tg-lqy6{text-align:right;vertical-align:top}
          .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
          .tg .tg-dvpl{border-color:inherit;text-align:right;vertical-align:top}
          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
